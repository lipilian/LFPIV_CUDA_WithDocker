HOW TO RUN/BUILD LFDISPLAY FROM SOURCE

Dependences: 
 * Python 
 * QCam for Python (included)
 * FreeImage 
 * PyQt 
 * setuptools 
 * numpy 
 * PyOpenGL3

Optional: 
 * drivers for QImaging cameras (not needed for build, just at runtime) 
 * py2app (for packaging into standalone)
 * py2exe (for packaging into standalone)

Building on Mac
 * Install QCam for Python (TODO : I will check if necessary)
 * Install FreeImage (into /usr/local/lib, etc. as a shared library) 
 * Install PyQt 
 * Install setuptools (using ez_setup.py to bootstrap initially) 
   (http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py)
 * Install numpy using setuptools 
 * Install PyOpenGL using setuptools 
 * Install py2app using setuptools 
 * Delete the contents of the dist directory if necessary 
   (script will fail to overwrite some files) 
 * Run the package.py script 

Building on Windows

 * If you are using Python 2.6 or later, MSVC2008 redistrib libraries are needed for PyQt4, so install those 
    * Python 2.6 comes with MSVCR90.DLL, but PyQt4 needs the MSVCP90.DLL
     for the C++ stuff 
    * Copy MSVCP90.DLL from 
      C:\Windows\WinSxS\x86_Microsoft.VC90.CRT_1fc8b3b9a1e18e3b_9.0.21022.8_x-ww_d08d0375 
      (or wherever the redist package installed the DLLs) 
      into the directory where package.py is 
 * If Python 2.6+ is to be installed, make sure to install "for
   yourself" so that it leaves the SxS libraries in the Python base 
   directory (not available for Vista, so recommend Python 2.5 for Vista) 
 * Install QCam for Python 
 * Install FreeImage (stick .dll somewhere in your path) 
 * Install PyQt 
 * Install setuptools (using ez_setup.py to bootstrap initially) 
   (http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py)
 * Install PyOpenGL using setuptools 
 * Install numpy 
 * Install py2exe 
 * Delete the contents of the dist directory if necessary 
   (script will fail to overwrite files) 
 * Run the package.py script
